# 🔢 Number System Converter 💻
A feature-rich, console-based Number System Converter developed in the C programming language, designed with an interactive and colorful text-based user interface. This application allows users to seamlessly convert numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems — complete with a detailed log history and input validation.

🚀 Features
🧮 Comprehensive Conversions

Supports 12 types of number system conversions, including:

•	Binary ↔ Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal

•	Decimal ↔ Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal

•	Octal ↔ Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal

•	Hexadecimal ↔ Binary, Decimal, Octal

📁 Conversion History

•	Automatically logs each successful conversion

•	View full conversion history

•	Clear history at any time

🎨 Colorful User Interface

•	ANSI escape sequences used for color-coded menus

•	Improves readability and enhances user experience

🔐 Input Validation

•	Handles invalid inputs such as wrong binary/octal/hex characters

•	Provides clear error messages and guidance to users

🔁 Repetition Made Easy

•	Every operation supports retrying with just one prompt
